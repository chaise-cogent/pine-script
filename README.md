# PineScript helper code/scripts

Code is on the `src` folder:

- [MACD with divergence + Leader](./src/macd-divergence.pine)
- [Week candle finished yesterday](./week-candle-finished-yesterday.pine)
- [ZigZag Swing Cycle average length counter](./src/zigzag-swing-cycle-avg-length.md)

## Outdated:
- [~Week candles' start day backward shift~](./src/week-candle-start-day-backward-shift.pine)
— see `Week candle finished yesterday` instead
